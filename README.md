# Introduction
This project demonstrates a complete, production-style Azure data engineering pipeline built to ingest, transform, and analyze sales data from GitHub all the way to Power BI. It reflects real-world data engineering practices, including cloud orchestration, lakehouse architecture, incremental processing, and business-focused reporting.

The goal is to show how raw sales data can be transformed into actionable insights using scalable Azure services.
